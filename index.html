            and i really like music and movies.
            I served a full time mission in Ghana Accra.
            I learned that the lord can help us in many ways
            even when we feel lost or depressed.
            I decided to further my education through BYU pathway worldwide.

            technology, especially AI. I know, if i work hard i can achieve this Goal. </p>
