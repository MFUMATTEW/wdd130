            Hello my name is Flavien Mabouba, i am from Gabon,
            and i really like music and movies.
            I served a full time mission in Ghana Accra.
            I learned that the lord can help us in many ways
            even when we feel lost or depressed.
            I decided to further my education through BYU pathway worldwide.
            I have always been interested by new technologies, that is
            why i chose Software and development. I want to learn more about
            technology, especially AI. I know, if i work hard i can achieve this Goal.

        <p>
            Libreville is my favorite city and it's also my capital. The city hosts
            around 900 000 inhabitants and is very beautiful. We Gabonese live in
            Libreville and apreciate the peaceful aspect of the city. Libreville
            has different spots were you can relax chill and also have fun. One
            of them is "La baie des rois" a really nice spot were you can relax
            and have a good time with friends and family.
